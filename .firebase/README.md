## .firebase/

This directory should contain service account credentials for the Firebase Admin SDK.

These credentials are the same for any Google Cloud API, but rather than create seperate credentials, just reuse the Firebase Admin credentials.

**DO NOT COMMIT THE JSON FILE!**

These credntials should always be kept private and out of version control as it allows complete access to Firebase with _full_ admin privileges.
